// Question //
// Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. 
// The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information.
// Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums.
// Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly.
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album.
// If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object.
// Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.

{
    Artist: string;
    Title: string;
    Tracks?: number;
