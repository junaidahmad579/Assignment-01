// Question //
// Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
//• Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
//• Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
//• Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a
//message that the person will need to enter a new username. 
// If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.
//• Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.
